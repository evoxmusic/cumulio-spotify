# cumulio-spotify

cuMusicalio is an app that integrates a Cumul.io dashboards that displays playlist and song analytics. Users have the choice of  logging in to their Spotify account abd use the dashboards to add songs to their own Spotify playlists, or create dashboards for their own playlists. 

This project is a demonstration of how Cumul.io `Custom Events` can be used for bidirectional communication between Cumul.io and your own platform. The 2 main events here are:
1. Add to Playlist: Where you can add a song to one of your own playlists by selecting it from the chart
2. Song Info: Where you can select a song to display a `drill-through` dashboard that displays in detail information on the song's acoustincness, danceablity and energy.
